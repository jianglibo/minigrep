I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

We'll want to generate a .lib file from the .def file.
lib /def:sqlite3.def /out:sqlite3.lib

Set-Item -Path env:SQLITE3_LIB_DIR -Value "F:\sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3260000"

below does't work. set system environment is simpler.
"rust.cargoEnv": {
    "SQLITE3_LIB_DIR": "F:/sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3260000"
}
and need to add sqlite path to system path.

# The `source` table is where all keys related to source-replacement
# are stored.
[source]

# Under the `source` table are a number of other tables whose keys are a
# name for the relevant source. For example this section defines a new
# source, called `my-awesome-source`, which comes from a directory
# located at `vendor` relative to the directory containing this `.cargo/config`
# file
[source.my-awesome-source]
directory = "vendor"

# Git sources can optionally specify a branch/tag/rev as well
git = "https://example.com/path/to/repo"
# branch = "master"
# tag = "v1.0.1"
# rev = "313f44e8"

# The crates.io default source for crates is available under the name
# "crates-io", and here we use the `replace-with` key to indicate that it's
# replaced with our source above.
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = "my-awesome-source"

put following line to ~\.cargo\config.
[source.crates-io]
replace-with = 'ustc'
[source.ustc]
