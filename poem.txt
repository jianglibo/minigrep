I'm nobody! Who are you?
Are you nobody, too?
Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!
They'd banish us, you know.

How dreary to be somebody!
How public, like a frog
To tell your name the livelong day
To an admiring bog!

F:\sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3260000, sqlite3.def, sqlite3.dll,
We'll want to generate a .lib file from the .def file.
lib /def:sqlite3.def /out:sqlite3.lib

Set-Item -Path env:SQLITE3_LIB_DIR -Value "F:\sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3260000"

below does't work. set system environment is simpler.
"rust.cargoEnv": {
    "SQLITE3_LIB_DIR": "F:/sqlite-dll-win64-x64-3260000"
}
and need to add sqlite path to system path.
